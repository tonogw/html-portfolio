  <!-- Project 1 -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Secure Host-to-Host CBEST Terminal Integration (KSEI-Citi) </h2>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Daily reporting to IDX required significant manual preparation and cross-checking, creating operational bottlenecks and regulatory risks.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Manual processes caused delays, increased human-error probability, and required extensive reconciliation efforts.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Identified automation opportunities, collaborated with technology teams, and proposed a host-to-host integration. Designed end-to-end workflow and coordinated regulatory alignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced reporting time from hours to minutes, eliminated manual intervention, achieved high compliance accuracy, and improved operational readiness. The solution was approved directly by IDX.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Process engineering, automation design, compliance, cross-functional leadership.</p>

    <h2>Automation of IDX CTP Regulatory Reporting (Citi)</h2>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Daily reporting to IDX required significant manual preparation and cross-checking, creating operational bottlenecks and regulatory risks.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Manual processes caused delays, increased human-error probability, and required extensive reconciliation efforts.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Identified automation opportunities, collaborated with technology teams, and proposed a host-to-host integration. Designed end-to-end workflow and coordinated regulatory alignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced reporting time from hours to minutes, eliminated manual intervention, achieved high compliance accuracy, and improved operational readiness. The solution was approved directly by IDX.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Process engineering, automation design, compliance, cross-functional leadership.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Project 2 -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>SWIFT Cost Optimization through Process Correction (Deutsche Bank)</h2>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> SWIFT billing showed unusually high charges, prompting investigation into underlying causes.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Incorrect SWIFT environment routing caused unnecessary billing related to test and production message handling.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Conducted deep-dive analysis, identified the incorrect ON/OFF switching mechanism controlling SWIFT test environments, and designed a corrected operational process.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Prevented an annual unnecessary cost of USD 150,000 and restored proper environment handling.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> SWIFT expertise, analytical investigation, process correction, operational risk mitigation.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Project 3 -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Legacy 3270 Automation for Remittance & Operations</h2>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Operational staff used IBM 3270 terminal for routine tasks, many of which were repetitive and time-consuming.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> High volume of manual keystrokes introduced fatigue, errors, and inefficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Built automation macros using IBM HLLAPI scripting combined with Excel VBA triggers to streamline multi-step routines.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Significantly reduced manual keystrokes, lowered error rates, and increased throughput without requiring system changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> VBA automation, HLLAPI scripting, workflow optimization.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Project 4 -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Enterprise Application Ownership & Technology Governance (Citi)</h2>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Managed multiple enterprise applications used for retail, corporate, and custodian operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Needed enhanced governance, change management, and audit readiness across nine application domains.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Led UAT cycles, coordinated with global/regional IT, ensured compliance with internal controls, and delivered upgrades with zero disruption.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased system reliability, maintained full compliance, and ensured alignment with global architecture standards.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> IT governance, change management, cross-functional leadership.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Project 5 -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>IoT Utility Recording Architecture Design (3 Towers Residences)</h2>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Utility meter reading was performed manually by engineering staff, requiring over 5 working days each month.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Manual processes limited billing timeliness, accuracy, and real-time visibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Designed a scalable IoT architecture utilizing Modbus RS485, Node-RED monitoring, and connected smart meters. Proposed workflow changes for end-to-end process improvement.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Proposed system could reduce process time from 5 days to under 1 hour, enabling billing issuance on the first day of each month. Improved data accuracy and operational efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> IoT system design, business process re-engineering, technical architecture documentation.</p>
